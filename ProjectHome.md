The **iOS Configuration Client** provides administrators the ability to configure a SitesWrapper site using the familiar iOS app settings screens.

The iOS app contains settings screens covering all aspects of the site as well as the ability to add or remove pages or Google Sites within pages.

Settings defined in the setting screens of the configuration client are propagated on demand to the entity objects in the GAE datastore.
