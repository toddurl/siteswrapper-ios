SitesWrapper-iOS
==============

DESCRIPTION
===========

The iOS Configuration Client provides administrators the ability to configure  a
SitesWrapper site using the familiar iOS app settings screens.

The iOS app contains settings screens covering all aspects of the site  as  well
as the ability to add or remove pages or Google Sites within pages.

Settings defined  in  the  setting  screens  of  the  configuration  client  are
propagated on demand to the entity objects in the GAE datastore.
